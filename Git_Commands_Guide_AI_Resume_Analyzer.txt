 GIT COMMANDS GUIDE — AI_Resume_Analyzer
=========================================

# 1️⃣ Navigate to your project folder
cd C:\Users\saiku\Desktop\Projects\ai_resume_analyzer
# → Moves into your local project directory.

# 2️⃣ Initialize a new Git repository (only needed the first time)
git init
# → Creates a new Git repository in the current folder (adds a hidden .git folder).

# 3️⃣ Check current Git remote (optional)
git remote -v
# → Lists existing remote connections to GitHub (if any).

# 4️⃣ If an old remote exists and you want to replace it:
git remote remove origin
# → Removes the old remote connection.

# 5️⃣ Add your GitHub repository as the new remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/SAIKUMAR-69/AI_Resume_Analyzer.git
# → Connects your local folder to the GitHub repo.

# 6️⃣ Verify remote connection
git remote -v
# → Confirms that your local repo is linked correctly to GitHub.

# 7️⃣ Check current Git status
git status
# → Shows which files are new, modified, or staged for commit.

# 8️⃣ Stage all files for commit (add updated files including README.md)
git add .
# → Adds all changes (new, edited, or deleted files) to the staging area.

# 9️⃣ Commit the changes with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Update README.md with structured sections and improved content"
# → Saves a snapshot of your project’s current state.

# 10️⃣ Push your changes to GitHub (main branch)
git push origin main
# → Uploads your committed changes from local to your GitHub repository.

# 11️⃣ If you get an error like "branch main not found", rename your branch:
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
# → Ensures your local branch name matches the GitHub main branch.

# 12️⃣ Verify your push
# Go to your GitHub repo in browser:
# https://github.com/SAIKUMAR-69/AI_Resume_Analyzer
# → Refresh the page; your updated README.md should appear.

=========================================
✅ Done! Your README.md and all project updates are now live on GitHub.
